This dataset is essential for analyzing patterns and causes of accidents to improve road safety.\n","\n","### Data Characteristics\n","- **Entries**: The dataset contains 12,316 entries.\n","- **Features**: There are 32 features in the dataset, which include:\n","  - `Time`: Time when the accident occurred.\n","  - `Day_of_week`: Day of the week.\n","  - `Age_band_of_driver`: Age group of the driver involved.\n","  - `Sex_of_driver`: Gender of the driver.\n","  - `Educational_level`: Educational level of the driver.\n","  - `Type_of_vehicle`: Type of vehicle involved in the accident.\n","  - `Cause_of_accident`: Reported cause of the accident.\n","  - `Accident_severity`: Severity of the accident.\n","- **Target Column**: `Accident_severity` is used as the target column for modeling. This feature classifies the severity of each accident.\n","\n","### Objective\n","Students will use this dataset to apply various data visualization, modeling, and evaluation techniques learned in class. The primary goal is to build models that can accurately predict the severity of accidents and to identify the key factors that contribute to severe accidents."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"177291c2","metadata":{"id":"177291c2"},"source":["## Import Libraries\n","Import all the necessary libraries here.

(Be careful not to increase the dimensionality significantly)\n","- **Detection and Treatment of Outliers**: Use statistical tests, box plots, or scatter plots to identify outliers and then cap, trim, or use robust methods to reduce the effect of outliers, depending on the context.\n","- **Feature Engineering**: Enhance your dataset by creating new features and transforming existing ones. This might involve combining data from different columns, applying transformations, or reducing dimensionality with techniques like PCA to improve model performance.\n","\n","Consider these steps as a

Questions:\n","\n","### Comparative Analysis\n","\n","- **Compare Metrics**: Examine the performance metrics (such as accuracy, precision, and recall) of each model. Document your observations on which model performs best for your dataset and the problem you're addressing.\n","- **Evaluate Trade-offs**: Discuss the trade-offs you encountered when choosing between models. Consider factors like computational efficiency, ease of implementation, and model interpretability.\n","- **Justify Your Choice**: After comparing and evaluating, explain why you believe one model is the best choice. Provide a clear rationale based on the performance metrics and trade-offs discussed.\n","- **Feature Importance**: Identify and discuss the most important features for the best-performing model. How do these features impact the predictions? Use the visualizations you have created to justify your answer if necessary.\n","- **Model Limitations**: Discuss any limitations you encountered with the models you used. Are there any aspects of the data or the problem that these models do not handle well?\n","- **Future Improvements**: Suggest potential improvements or further steps you could take to enhance model performance. This could include trying different algorithms, feature engineering techniques, or tuning hyperparameters."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"76425529","metadata":{"id":"76425529"},"source":["### Answer Here:"]}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python"},"colab":{"provenance":[{"file_id":"1MCZjdefxYX0BcKcEWNRzZsul4OWrWoR2","timestamp":1722502469852}]},"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
